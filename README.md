# Make School Calculator

### How It Works

1. First input takes the number of new students enrolled into Make School.

2. Second input takes the number of drop out students from Make School.

3. Dropdown selector has 2 options: 1 academic year and 2 academic year.

4. Based on this information the Make School Calculator calculates how much profit Make School has every academic year by taking (new students - drop out students) * 1 academic year ($35,000) or 2 academic year ($ 70,000)
